# Color spaces

### HSV

Hue tells the color. Saturation is how pure the color is, i.e. the maximum difference in RGB channel values, with low values resulting in gray. Change in value makes the whole thing brighter or darker.

### YCpCr

Y component contains the gray scale image. Link asking for [intuition](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/4849/understanding-cb-and-cr-components-of-ycbcr-color-space) for Cp and Cr components, which encode the color. Used in video as eye is most sensitive to the Y component and Cp and Cr components can be compressed.
